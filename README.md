# **Introduction:**

I have taken this case study from the Google Data Analytics courses on Coursera. In this case , I perform data analysis for a fictional bike-share company in order to help them attract more riders.

# **Scenario:**

I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve the  recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

There are six tips of the case: Ask , Prepare,  Process, Analysis, Share and Act.

# Ask

- How do annual members and casual riders use differ ent?
- Why would casual riders buy annual membership?
- How can Cyclist u4se digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

# Prepare

## **Data source**

I will use Cyclisticâ€™s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends.(Note: The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study,the datasets are appropriate and will enable you to answer the business questions. The data has been made available byMotivate International Inc. under this [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).) This is public data which can use to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes. But note that data-privacy issues prohibit you from using ridersâ€™ personally identifiable information.

I have used the dataset from August2021 to July2022.

The combined size of all the 12 datasets is close to 1 GB. Data cleaning in spreadsheets will slow compared to SQL or R. I chose R to clean data and analysis, visualizations in the same platform.
